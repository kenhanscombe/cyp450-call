# PGx allele/phenotype calling

<span>&#9760;</span> This was a work-in-progress pipeline to replicate the application of [PGxPOP](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2122) to the UKB imputed and 200k exome release. The original publication applied to the PGxPOP to the 50k release. Several tools had to be swapped out for the larger sample, e.g., SHAPEIT4 for Eagle phasing.

__The workflow does not work as is and has been saved here for reference.__

Note. The full exome data (500k release) has since become available and is only accessible through the UKB RAP.
